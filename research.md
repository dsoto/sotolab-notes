# Productivity

Research is an ambiguous task.  We will be working on the skill of
defining a large question that we are interested in and then breaking
that down into smaller tasks that we can accomplish on a weekly
timeframe.  This is a useful skill to develop since decomposing large
tasks into smaller ones is key for many jobs and careers.

# Authorship

In this lab, I adhere to the definitions for authorship from the
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  For authorship to
be awarded, all of the following conditions must be met.

- Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or
  the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work

- Final approval of the version to be published
- Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
  that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the
