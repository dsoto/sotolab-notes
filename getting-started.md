# Getting Started

We use several online tools to collaborate and communicate.  New members
can enlist the help of existing group members to get set up on these
tools.

# Communication and Organization

We use many tools for sharing our work with the team.

## Chatrooms

Most of our lab communication is in a single chatroom rather than email.
This way any written communication is available to all members of the
group.  This allows the team to stay current with the issues others are
having.

You will receive an invitation to join our chatroom via email.

## Google Drive

For simple documents, we use google drive.  SSU students have an Google
Drive account.  Please provide me with your user name and I can share
our folders with you.

## Virtual Lab Book

You will keep a virtual lab book and post it to GitHub.  You can place a
link to it in the Wiki with Daniel Soto's lab book repository.  As you
do work, you will post files with your thoughts, code, or results so
that the other members can keep up with your progress.

Markdown files work well if you aren't generating graphs or explaining
code.  Jupyter Notebooks work well when you want to show lots of code,
tables, or graphs.  Both of these are rendered nicely on GitHub so
others can view your work.

## Story Boards

For each of our projects, we maintain a "Story Board" in our Google
Drive.  This contains the overall plan of all the tasks associated with
the project from question definition to analysis to publication.  Read
through these to determine where you can best contribute.

## GitHub

If you don't have an account, please set one up on GitHub.  This site
allows us to collaborate on computer code where we want to use a
sophisticated version control system to keep track of changes to our
work.  Once you have this account username, send it to me and I can add
you to whatever repositories you should have access to.

## Work Plans

Each week we write down the things we hope to accomplish and our
estimates of the time it will take.  At the end of the week we review
these and see if what we did matched our plans.  This helps us to focus
our efforts and to get a better estimate of how long different tasks
take to accomplish.

# Tools

We do most of our analysis and communication using the Python scientific
libraries and the Jupyter platform.

## Anaconda

We use the conda package manager to install our Python environments.
You can download a copy [here.](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)

## Libraries

- Pandas provides a spreadsheet-like object for analysis
- Matplotlib is a basic plotting library
- Seaborn allows for powerful statistical plots

You can install these libraries using conda once you have it installed.

```
> conda install pandas
```
