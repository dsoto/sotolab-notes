# Getting Started

We use several online tools to collaborate and communicate.

## HipChat

Most of our lab communication is in a single chatroom rather than email.
This way any written communication is available to all members of the
group.  This allows the team to stay current with the issues others are
having.

You will receive an invitation to HipChat and we will invite you to the
rooms we use for communication.

## Google Drive

For simple documents, we use google drive.  SSU students have an Google
Drive account.  Please provide me with your user name and I can share
our folders with you.

## GitHub

If you don't have an account, please set one up on GitHub.  This site
allows us to collaborate on computer code where we want to use a
sophisticated version control system to keep track of changes to our
work.  Once you have this account username, send it to me and I can add
you to whatever repositories you should have access to.
