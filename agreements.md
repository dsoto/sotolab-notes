# Lab goals
My research goals are to identify technologies and systems to increase
access to energy services throughout the world.  The work we do spans
technology and economics.

As a researcher, your primary responsibility is to produce research.
You will learn new skills but maintain an emphasis on accomplishing the
goals you set for yourself.

During our meetings, we will review our progress since the last meeting,
revisit the tasks we want to accomplish, and make a time budget for the
tasks we want to accomplish by the next meeting.  As an undergraduate
you have many demands on your time and explicit planning of your time
and tasks can help you stay productive in your many responsibilities.
